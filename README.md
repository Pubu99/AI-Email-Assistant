## üöÄ Features

- **Email Intent Classification:** Automatically categorize emails (e.g., Meeting Request, Complaint, Sales Inquiry) using transformer-based NLP models.
- **Reply Generation:** Generate context-aware, professional replies using T5 and advanced prompt engineering.
- **Entity Extraction:** Enhance responses with named entities (dates, names, topics) via spaCy.
- **Fullstack Demo:** React frontend + FastAPI backend for seamless user experience.
- **MLOps Pipeline:** Dockerized training, serving, and monitoring. MLflow for experiment tracking.

## üß† Model Training & Evaluation

- Train models in Docker or on a powerful machine, then copy `models/` to your local setup.
- Use Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Evaluate models with `scripts/evaluate_models.py` for BLEU, ROUGE, accuracy, and more.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è MLOps & Deployment

- All services are containerized for reproducibility.
- MLflow tracks experiments and model versions.
- Monitoring scripts in `mlops/` for health and performance.

---

## üìÅ Data & Privacy

- Place raw datasets in `data/raw/` (not tracked by git).
- Preprocessed data in `data/processed/`.
- Models and sensitive files are gitignored by default.
